## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
We can add more than two bits together by including additional full adders for the bits being added in.
### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The importance  of the XOR gate in an adder is to have a correct solution. In this lab, the XOR is acting as our stair light and doing binary addition of a single digit.
### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number a two bit adder can handle is three. If the sum went over three, there would be an overflow and the msb is not included in this case.

Summary:
In this lab, we learned how to create and program logic equations for a one bit adder and a 2-bit adder. We were also able to implement a full adder and create equations with the help of K-maps. We were then able to combine the three blocks to create a "stairway" light switch using XOR equations.
